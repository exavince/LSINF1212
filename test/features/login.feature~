Feature: Loging in on the web site

In order to gain access to the web site
As a scout (leader or not)
I want to be able to connect to my personnal account

Scenario: A scout tries to log in while not being registred on the web site yet
Given a user not registred on the web site
When the user tries to log in
Then the loging in fails
And the user is notified of the error
And is redirected to the signup part of the web site

Scenario: A scout tries to log in with his own account he previously created
Given a user registred on the web site
When the user tries to log in with correct identifiers
Then the loging in succeeds
And the user is now connected
And is redirected to the main page of the web site
