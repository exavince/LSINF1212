Feature: Signing up on the web site

In order to gain access to the web site
As a scout (leader or not)
I want to be able to create my personnal account

Scenario: A scout signs up on the web site with a new username
Given a user not registred on the web site
When the user tries to sign up with a non yet used username
Then a new user with entered identifiers is created
And the user is now logged in on the web site
And is redirected to the main page of the web site

Scenario: A scout signs up on the web site with existing username
Given a user not registred on the web site
When the user tries to sign up with an already used username
Then the user is notified of the error
And is redirected to the sign up page of the web site
